=begin
Perform all bitwise operation and printing output of them

this code will helpful to understand what is diff type of bitwise operators.

=end


a=2
b=3


puts a & b  #010 & 011 = 010 (only true if both 1)
puts a | b  #010 | 011 = 011 (true when any bit 1)
puts a^b    #only true of both bit is diff
puts ~2     #reverse bit and add 1 into last bit
